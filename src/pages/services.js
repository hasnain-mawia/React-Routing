Youth from ages 15–17 are four times more likely to be out of school than children 6–11, and in sub-Saharan Africa alone, one in every three children are out of school.1 Just 50 percent of primary school aged refugee children are enrolled in school, and 25 percent of secondary aged refugee children are enrolled in school.2 In 1820, just 12 percent of the world could read and write.1 Today, 86 percent of the world is literate.3 Two thirds of the world’s illiterate population are women.4 In 43 nations, women aged 15-24 are less likely to be literate than men, primarily in Northern Africa and Western Asia.</p>
